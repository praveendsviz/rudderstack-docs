## Identify
The `identify` call helps you to assocaite a user to their activities and capture relevant traits about them. These traits could be a user ID, email, name etc. Once you call the `identify` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk [`identify`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/identify) event will be triggered. Lemnisk needs a unique user ID to associate an event with a user. By default, we will use our cookie to identify the user. Optionally, a unique user ID can be passed in the first parameter.
<Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call
A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("", {
  name: "Name Surname",
  first_name: "Name",
  last_name: "Surname",
  email: "name@surname.com",
  phone: "+919xxxxxxxxx"
})
```
> **_NOTE:_**  `identify` call is not supported in server-side integration.

## Track
The `track` API call records the actions that the users perform, along with the properties of the action. Each action is called an event. Each event has a name and some properties associated with it along with an optional callback function. For example, the event name could be `productViewed`, while the properties can be `sort`, `currencyCode` etc. Once you call the `track` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk [`track`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/track) event will be triggered.
<Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call
A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Viewed", {
    currencyCode: "INR",
    filters: "Price < 5000",
    sort: "Price (Low to High)",
    product: {
        name: "Earbuds",
        category: "Mobile Phone & Accessories",
        position: 1
    }
})
```

## Page
The page call lets you record when a user views a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page. Once you call the `page` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk [`page`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/page) event will be triggered.
<Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call
A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
lmSMTObj.page("home", {
	"path": "/academy/",
	"title": "Analytics Academy",
	"url": "https://lemnisk.co"
})
```
> **_NOTE:_** `page` call is not supported in server-side integration.
